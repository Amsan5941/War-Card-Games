# War-Card-Games
 Simulation of the game of War using a shuffled deck of 52 cards. Players take turns revealing the top card of their pile, with the higher card winning both. Ties lead to a "war", where players turn up more cards until a winner is determined. The game continues until one player runs out of cards.

Game description:
 The game starts with a shuffled deck of cards. The deck will be passed into your program
 already shuffled (details below). The cards are dealt in an alternating fashion to each player,
 so that each player has 26 cards.
 In each round, both players reveal the top card of their pile. The player with the higher card
 (by rank) wins both cards, placing them at the bottom of their pile. Aces are considered
 high, meaning the card ranks in ascending order are 2-10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace.
 If the revealed cards are tied, there is war! Each player turns up one card face down
 followed by one card face up. The player with the higher face-up card takes both piles (six
 cards â€“ the two original cards that were tied, plus the four cards from the war). If the
 turned-up cards are again the same rank, each player places another card face down and
 turns another card face up. The player with the higher card takes all 10 cards, and so on.
 When one player runs out of cards, they are the loser, and the other the winner. If, during a
 war, a player runs out of cards, this counts as a loss as well.
