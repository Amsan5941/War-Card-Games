# War-Card-Games
 Simulation of the game of War using a shuffled deck of 52 cards. Players take turns revealing the top card of their pile, with the higher card winning both. Ties lead to a "war", where players turn up more cards until a winner is determined. The game continues until one player runs out of cards.
